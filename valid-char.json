Once, their life was a quiet rhythm of work and small affection; then everything changed in a single, terrible moment — a fire, a betrayal, a proclamation from a dying hand. That fracture marked them: everything before is dim, and everything after is the long, burning attempt to put the pieces back together in a world that insists on asking for more. A central figure: Serah has left a mark on their life. A notable episode: once defeated a band of raiders in a night that songs still whisper about.",

A connection to They have a nemesis who is identical to them in every way except for moral alignment complicates their path. Serah factors into their motives. An obsession — Collects different types of buttons and sews them onto their clothing in meaningful patterns — colors their choices. Rumors of once defeated a band of raiders in a night that songs still whisper about first drew them to travel."
