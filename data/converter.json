There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived.\n4 Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you.\n5 After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle.\n6 While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you.\n\nBuilding a Giant Foundling Character\nYour life among giants has given you a unique perspective. Though you are unusually large for your kind, you're no larger than a giant child, so you might be very mindful of your size.\n\nFeature: Strike of the Giants\nYou gain the Strike of the Giants feat.\n\nSuggested Characteristics\nThe Giant Foundling Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.\n\nd6 Personality Trait\n1 What I lack in stature compared to giants, I make up for with sheer spite.\n2 I insist on being taken seriously as a full-grown adult. Nobody talks down to me!\n3 Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I'd much rather be in an open field than a bustling tavern.\n4 I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed\u2014and underestimated.\n5 Every avalanche begins as a single pebble.\n6 The world always feels too big, and I'm afraid I'll never find my place in it."

			"text": "# Introduction\n\nThis book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature and magic item that appears in the adventure. It also introduces the world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the game's most enduring settings, and it teaches you how to run a D&D game.\n\nThe smaller book that accompanies this one (hereafter called \"the rulebook\") contains the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.\n\n#### The Dungeon Master\n\nThe Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the Dungeons & Dragons game.\n\nThe DM is a **referee**. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.\n\n\n> ##### Rules to Game By\n>\n>As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.\n>\n>- **When in doubt, make it up!** It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.\n>- **It's not a competition.** The DM isn't competing against the player characters. You're there to run the monsters, referee the rules, and keep the story moving.\n>- **It's a shared story.** It's the group's story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their characters. Dungeons & Dragons is about imagination and coming together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.\n>- **Be consistent.** If you decide that a rule works a certain way in one session, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play.\n>- **Make sure everyone is involved.** Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.\n>- **Be fair.** Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.\n>- **Pay attention.** Make sure you look around the table occasionally to see if the game is going well. If everyone seems to be having fun, relax and keep going. If the fun is waning, it might be time for a break, or you can try to liven things up.\n\n#### Improvising Ability Checks\n\nThe adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. It's up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check; just tell the player what happens. Likewise, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.\n\nOtherwise, answer these three simple questions:\n\n- What kind of ability check?\n- How hard is it?\n- What's the result?\n\nUse the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use. Then determine how hard the task is so that you can set the DC for the check. The higher the DC, the more difficult the task. The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these three DCs:\n\n- **Easy (DC 10)**. An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.\n- **Moderate (DC 15)**. A moderate task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with a combination of natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.\n- **Hard (DC 20)**. Hard tasks include any effort that is beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability.\n\n#### Abbreviations\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in this adventure:\n\n| Abbreviation          | Abbreviation           |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| DC = Difficulty Class | XP = experience points |\n| gp = gold piece(s)    | pp = platinum piece(s) |\n| sp = silver piece(s)  | ep = electrum piece(s) |\n| cp = copper piece(s)  | -                      |"

			"text": "Wreath of the Prism\nWondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)\nThis loop of golden thorns is inset with dozens of gems representing the five colors of Tiamat.\nDormant\nWhile wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the wreath increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.\nWhen you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast dominate monster on the creature (save DC 13). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target's neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer charmed by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.\nAwakened\nOnce the Wreath of the Prism reaches an awakened state, it gains the following benefits:\n• You can affect creatures of challenge rating 10 or lower with the wreath.\n• The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 15.\nExalted\nOnce the Wreath of the Prism reaches an exalted state, it gains the following benefits:\n• You can affect creatures of challenge rating 15 or lower with the wreath.\n• The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 17."
