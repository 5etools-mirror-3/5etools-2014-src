												"The game's rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use.",
												"The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become unplayable. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of D&D. The direction we chose for the current edition was to lay a foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we embraced the DM's role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.",
												"In a typical D&D session, a DM makes numerous rules decisions\u2014some barely noticeable and others quite obvious. Players also interpret the rules, and the whole group keeps the game running. There are times, though, when the design intent of a rule isn't clear or when one rule seems to contradict another.",

If you have access to more than one, you pick which one to use. For example, if you're a sorcerer/monk, you can use either Unarmored Defense or Draconic Resilience, not both. Similarly, a druid/ barbarian who transforms into a beast form that has natural armor can use either the beast's natural armor or Unarmored Defense (you aren't considered to be wearing armor when you use natural armor).",
														"What about a shield? A shield increases your AC by 2 while you use it. For example, if you're unarmored and use a shield, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. Keep in mind that some AC calculations, such as a monk's Unarmored Defense, prohibit the use of a shield.",
														"Once you have your base AC, it can be temporarily modified by situational bonuses and penalties. For instance, having half cover gives you a +2 bonus to your AC, and three-quarters cover gives a +5 bonus. Spells sometimes modify AC as well. {@spell Shield of faith}, for example, grants a target a +2 bonus to AC until the spell ends.",
														"Magic items can also enhance your AC. Here are a few examples: {@item +1 chain mail} gives you an AC of 17, a {@item ring of protection} gives you a +1 bonus to AC no matter what you're wearing, and {@item bracers of defense} grant you a +2 bonus to AC if you're not wearing armor or using a shield."

This determination happens only once during a fight and only at the beginning. In other words, once a fight starts, you can't be {@status surprised} again, although a hidden foe can still gain the normal benefits from being unseen (see \"{@book Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB|9|Unseen Attackers and Targets}\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).",
												"To be {@status surprised}, you must be caught off guard, usually because you failed to notice foes being stealthy or you were startled by an enemy with a special ability, such as the {@creature Gelatinous Cube||gelatinous cube's} Transparent trait, that makes it exceptionally surprising. You can be {@status surprised} even if your companions aren't, and you aren't {@status surprised} if even one of your foes fails to catch you unawares.",
												"If anyone is {@status surprised}, no actions are taken yet. First, initiative is rolled as normal. Then, the first round of combat starts, and the {@status surprised|PHB|unsurprised} combatants act in initiative order. A {@status surprised} creature can't move or take an action or a {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} until its first turn ends (remember that being unable to take an action also means you can't take a bonus action). In effect, a {@status surprised} creature skips its first turn in a fight. Once that turn ends, the creature is no longer {@status surprised}.",
												"In short, activity in a combat is always ordered by initiative, whether or not someone is {@status surprised}, and after the first round of combat has passed, surprise is no longer a factor.

												"Whenever you wonder whether a spell's effects can be dispelled or suspended, you need to answer one question: is the spell's duration instantaneous? If the answer is yes, there is nothing to dispel or suspend. Here's why: the effects of an {@book instantaneous spell|PHB|10|Instantaneous} are brought into being by magic, but the effects aren't sustained by magic. The magic flares for a split second and then vanishes. For example, the instantaneous spell {@spell animate dead} harnesses magical energy to turn a corpse or a pile of bones into an undead creature. That necromantic magic is present for an instant and is then gone. The resulting undead now exists without the magic's help. Casting {@spell dispel magic} on the creature can't end its mockery of life, and the undead can wander into an {@spell antimagic field} with no adverse effect.",
